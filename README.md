This is one of assignment from Coding Dojo. Using Django, building a simple survey form web app.

*Description*

As you build the app described below, make sure you feel very comfortable with how information can be relayed between a **form** and controller/view (found in **views.py** currently), and how **session** and **POST** data are being handled.
